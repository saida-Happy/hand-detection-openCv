# hand-detection-opencv

This is a hand detection programm written in Java using OpenCV3.0, the programm is capable of recognizing hands in an video.
The project involves simulating a hand gesture to capture an image from a video stream.
# Goal

Once this gesture is detected (eg an open hand) a complete image is saved.
# Usage

This software has been developed on Netbeans IDE 8.2 using OpenCV3.0. 
If you are using the same development environment you can simply clone the project and open it in Visual Studio.

Remember to create an environment variable called OPENCV_PATH that points to the build folder of OpenCV (eg: C:\Users\UserName\Documents\opencv\build). Otherwise you will need to update the properties of the project so that it knows where OpenCV is on your machine.
